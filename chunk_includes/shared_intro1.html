<p> Welcome! In this experiment, you will have to read certain sentences: a question, an answer to that question and another statement.</p>
<p> Then you will have to decide whether, starting from the answer to the question, you can conclude that the other statement also holds.</p>
 <p> Do not evaluate the sentences in terms of school grammar, simply follow your own intuition.</p>
